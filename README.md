# Game Clock

Have you ever been playing a bord game with your friend but there is always *that* one friend that takes __*forever*__ to finish their turn?

With Game Clock that is a thing of the past!

Game Clock is a website that users login, only using an username, join a room and when the host starts the game everyone is given 10 minutes count down that ticks down on their turn!

With Game Clock you can play an exiting bord game and wont have that one __*forever turn*__ friend!

## Teck Stack

## Future of the project
There are still many features left to implement but since this project is already at MVP stage it will not be my main project rather it will be my '*if I feel like programming on a sunday morning with hot coco*' project.
